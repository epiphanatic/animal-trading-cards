				<p>Although dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.</p>
